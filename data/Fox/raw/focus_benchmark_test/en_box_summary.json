These species have declined in recent years, with the onset of decline varying between species. The common eider and oystercatcher feed on large shellfish, while knot and herring gull feed on small shellfish. Common eiders primarily depend on subtidal areas for food, so the effect of closing intertidal areas was not investigated. Comparison of bird counts from before 1975 suggests that the decline in common eiders since 1975 is an artifact of the selected data. The recent decline in the Wadden Sea was accompanied by an increase in eiders using the North Sea coastal zone. However, this increase did not fully compensate for the decline in the Wadden Sea. The interpretation of these changes and the evaluation of the policy of food reservation for common eiders are discussed in chapter 5."
